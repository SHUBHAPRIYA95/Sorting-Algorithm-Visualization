A web application showcasing the inner workings of sorting algorithms.
Time complexity of algorithm being visualized.
* O(n²) - Bubble sort  
* O(n²) - Selection sort  
* O(n²) - Exchange sort 
* O(n²) - Insertion sort

# Some technical functional problem occur with mergesort,quicksort and heapsort so skipped them and add exchange sort.
